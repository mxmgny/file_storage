# file_storage
## web-app for temporary file storage 

Hi, Creating this app I used **Flask** framework. 
Its a lightweigh framework and have a lot of usefule modules. 
Working on it I used **flask_sqlalchemy** for **SQLite** database. 

For login form I used **flask_login** module.
This is the first time I create web app in my life actually. I never heard about flask until i get the task, 
so I'm sure i made a log of mistakes and waiting for your code review =)
I'm not giving commands for testing or running app cuz I'm not so confident about what's that yet. 
Maybe in a few hours of exploring documentation and few more commits i'll leave it here. Thanks for attention!


If you want run this app on your local machine you should preinstall flask and some more modules. 
The whole list of required modules contains in the [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) file.
